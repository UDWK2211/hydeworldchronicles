        There are places that don’t exist on Google Maps or Waze, places that would send any vehicle’s GPS into an existential crisis.<br>
        And yet, like a Gengar lurking in the shadows, they stubbornly persist.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-mage mage-2">
        Perhaps you ended up here by a navigational error.<br>
        Or perhaps “happenstance” is merely a fancy codename for forces that, unlike British bureaucracy, prefer not to fill out forms,<br>
        not to answer emails, and to dodge responsibility faster than Manchester United fleeing the top of the table on a bad day.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-mage mage-3">
        Something is being cooked here.<br>
        And no, it isn’t Ratatouille.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-mage mage-4">
        We are talking about badly told stories, mistakes older than the secrets of Hogwarts, escape routes designed to outmanoeuvre loan sharks,<br>
        and truths that took so long to mature they nearly became yet another Stephen King film adaptation.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-mage mage-5">
        It wasn’t for lack of warning.<br>
        It was an excess of silence, that very specific silence that precedes the omae wa mou shindeiru in a fighting anime.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-mage mage-6">
        What comes next is not an invitation to afternoon tea in the Shire, nor an announcement from Stark Industries.<br>
        It is a belated warning, the sort that only makes sense once the monster has already stepped out of the wardrobe<br>
        and you realise your only weapon is a broken umbrella.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-mage mage-6">
        I promise no clarity. I promise only notice.<br>
        The rest, my dear reader, you will have to interpret.
