      <p class="fade-in delay-1">Everything that’s truly worth it takes time.<br>
      That’s why I always arrive late.</p>

      <p class="fade-in delay-2">If you’re here, something went wrong.<br>
      Or right enough to become inconvenient.</p>

      <p class="fade-in delay-3">Sensible people don’t wander into places like this. They keep their distance.<br>
      The question isn’t about your sensibility, that was settled long ago.<br>
      Nor is it about how you got here. Happenstance also works its quiet mischief on boredom,<br>
      the kind that nudges us into clicking dubious websites at three in the morning.</p>

      <p class="fade-in delay-4">The real question is whether you’re capable of staying and waiting to find out what kind of fucking mess you’re about to walk into.</p>

      <p class="fade-in delay-4">I won’t make promises about what comes next. Promises create expectations, and expectations tend to end in disappointment, usually deserved.<br>
      I’ll only say this: what follows explains a great deal of what history prefers to ignore, misfile, or politely pretend never happened.</p>

      <p class="fade-in delay-5">Come back at your own risk. Later.<br>
      To see whether the veil has lifted by then.</p>

      <p class="fade-in delay-5">But if, like me, you’re a gossip… I mean, an eager adventurer, leave your email.<br>
      I’ll let you know when pretending you knew nothing is no longer an option.</p>
