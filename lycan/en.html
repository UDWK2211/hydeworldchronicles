        I know you felt it.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-2">
        No one comes this far without feeling something.<br>
        A strange weight in the chest, as though something ancient has shifted inside you.
        A discomfort that is not fear, it is recognition.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-3">
        Before churches, before calendars, before anyone believed the world could be named and contained by rules.<br>
        The old gods knew. Those who came before them knew as well.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-4">
        The world is not only what it appears to be.<br>
        Much of it lives in the shadows, as though the earth itself had a dark side,
        much like the moon.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-5">
        I heard the call for the first time when I still believed such things were only stories.
        I was wrong. The call does not ask permission. It does not explain itself.
        It demands.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-5">
        I do not promise control. Nor redemption.<br>
        I promise only this, when the moon rises, lies fall away.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-5">
        If you have read this far, it is because the call still echoes.<br>
        Perhaps faint. Perhaps persistent. Perhaps waiting for courage.
      </p>

      <p class="fade-lycan lycan-5">
        Leave a contact, if you wish.<br>
        When the moon changes, and it always does, I will let you know.
      </p>
